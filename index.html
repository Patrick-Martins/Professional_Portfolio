          <p>
            My name is <span style="color: #5d77ff; font-weight: 700;">Patrick Jensen Martins</span>, I'm 21 years old, I was born in Denmark and lived in Portugal since I was 4 years old until moving back to Denmark in 2018.<br />I am currently in
            my 3rd Smester of my AP Degree in Multimedia Design and Communication, at KEA. I became interested in coding since I was introduced to VisualBasic back in High School. I later worked with Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, while
            studying Electronic Engineering in Portugal. Web development is the perfect mix between coding and human interaction, what I love about it is that there are many aspects to consider when developing a website starting from research and
            never ending on a loop between testing and iteration. <br />
            I am a simple young student who likes to code, play videogames on my freetime, play football with friends and most importantly, spend time with my family and friends.

            <h1>Monty Python Basic Animation Project</h1>
            <p class="project_text">
              This was my first project with a group, during my study at KEA. We created an interactive website, intended for Cinemateket, with the basic knowledge about CSS positioning and animations that we had acquired. This interactive poster was
              to be used by a specific target group which we imagined and had to therefore be attractive and related to a movie selected by us, which was Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The website is only usable in desktop view.

            <h1>Huset Redesign Project</h1>
            <p class="project_text">
              In my second semester I was introduced to Wordpress and how to use it as a CMS. I worked with a group where we used Wordpress as a database to store all the movies, their text content and add events with a custom post type using the
              Pods framework and add labels to each post of that type. Individually we designed our version of the website, based on the current one.

            <h1>Website Developed For An Artist</h1>
            <p class="project_text">
              For the second semester final project, we were responsible for creating a digital strategy for an artist, which involved client research, market research, the development of a website that included a SEO Strategy and a content strategy
              for social media. All the content on the about page, the contact page and the paintings as well as the gallery elements are all dynamic and can therefore be edited by the artist in Wordpress. For a more detailed report of this project,
              feel free to access the final report.

            <h1>Interactive Animation for Danish Museum of Science Project</h1>
            <p class="project_text">
              After having learned the amazing manipulation powers on SVGs using Adobe Illustrator, Javascript and GSAP, I helped my group on creating an interactive website about the impact of the light bulb in our society, for our client, the
              Danish Museum of Science & Technology, we all designed SVGs for different elements of the room scene and the slides. I also worked on the functionality of the slides, changing the content inside them and going back and forward when a
              specific arrow is clicked as well as some animations using GSAP.
